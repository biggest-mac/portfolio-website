    <b>Bio</b>
    Ryan Mackenzi Wallace (b. 2002, United States)
    (illustration, analog film, found materials
    The focus of her work is...
    Wallace is interested in uncomfortable emotional truths and suspicious of conceptions of identity that demand rigid boundaries.  
    My work reflects my internal state at any given moment; I am much more interested in uncovering my subconscious through the visual associations it makes than trying to meticulously plan and execute a piece. 
    Often, this process requires a lot of Sitting in Rooms and Thinking About Stuff, which doesn't appear very exciting.
    
    themes: home, identity, disconnection, loss, grief, healing, memory, space-time, myth, psychology
    
    <b>Exhibitions</b>

<!--  
- I am a collector of various things
- I am a weave-togetherer of wild truths
- I am a seeker-finder of meaning, gleaned from (not so) random digging in (one day) archaeological sites
- I am a pile maker, a stacker, a sorter. a sifter
- I am a recorder and a player
- I am a feedback loop
- something something natural cycles, the moon

Defining my practice is difficult, mostly because I didn't think of myself as having a practice until very
recently. I find it difficult to notice the overarching themes of my work. Is it my ADHD, my dissociative habits
my anxiety? But when I allow myself the opportunity to face my work, I am met with my own obsessions. I am stuck
in the past 

I like to find accidental meaning, following my intuition and natural instincts. Like in spiritual rituals, I go
towards what resonates. Often I browse piles, collections, Stuff. And some of these objects have a gravity to
them. When I let myself be drawn in, I'm usually met with something serendipitous. When I experience
synchronicities I feel as if I am on the right track. 

A lot of my time is consumed by shame. It is a very easy emotion-state to drop into, and became indistinguishable
from my identity for most of my life. Inhabiting multiple identities that we are told are opposites, or seeking
acceptance and belonging from a society that doesn't care if i survive.

Escaping reality, into fantasy

my effort is put towards creating systems that sustain me, systems that support me and my fluctuations. 
it is my mission to become more resiliant, more autonomous, more free; to be this way requires discipline
i am an aspiring newton machine, a self sustaining system; i generate my own energy using my free will. 
the choices i make reverberate and echo through my systems. bleeding, bleeding, bleeding...

my work explores shame, memory, legibility, identity, inheritance...
